# Playwright Framework Standards Prompt

- All Playwright test classes must extend `BasePlaywrightTest`.
- Use `PlaywrightManager.getInstance()` to obtain the browser, context, and page.
- Do not use `Playwright.create()` or direct browser/page instantiation in test classes.
- Use `@BeforeClass` and `@AfterClass` for setup and teardown, delegating to `BasePlaywrightTest` where possible.
- Example test method:

  @Test
  public void testExample() {
      Page page = PlaywrightManager.getInstance().getPage();
      // test steps...
  }

- Use the Page Object Model for all page interactions.
- Follow Java and TestNG best practices for naming and structure.
- All test code should be readable, maintainable, and DRY.
