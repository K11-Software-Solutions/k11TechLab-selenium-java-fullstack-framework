Generate a complete, compilable Java TestNG test class using Playwright for Java.
Package: {packageName}
Class: {className}
MUST include:
- All required imports (Playwright, TestNG, ConfigurationManager, etc).
- A @BeforeClass setUp() method that launches Playwright, a Chromium browser in headless mode, and creates a Page. Store Playwright, Browser, and Page as fields.
- A @Test method that:
  - Reads weburl, username, and password using ConfigurationManager.getBundle().getPropertyValue('weburl'), etc.
  - Navigates to the weburl.
  - Fills the username and password fields and clicks the login button (use generic selectors if not specified).
  - Asserts that the dashboard is visible after login (e.g., page.isVisible('text=Dashboard')).
- A @AfterClass tearDown() method that closes the browser and Playwright.
- Output ONLY Java code, no markdown.
- The code must be complete and not truncated.
