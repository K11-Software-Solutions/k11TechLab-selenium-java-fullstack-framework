# K11 Tech Lab – Selenium Java Automation Framework

Getting Started with the Java-Based End-to-End Test Automation Framework:

This Java-based test automation framework is designed to support **end-to-end test coverage** across web, API, and database layers, with seamless CI/CD integration and enterprise-grade extensibility.


# 🤖 AI Enhancements (2025)

This framework now includes advanced AI-powered features for smarter, context-aware automation and documentation search:

- **Self-Healing Test Automation:**
   - AI-powered element locator healing for resilient UI tests
   - Automatically recovers from locator changes using semantic context and RAG
   - Reduces test flakiness and maintenance effort
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**
   - Semantic search and answer synthesis over your test docs and codebase
   - Supports OpenAI, HuggingFace, and local Ollama embeddings
   - Multi-provider, local/cloud, and offline AI support
- **Persistent Embedding Cache:**
   - Embeddings are computed once per document chunk and reused for all future runs
   - Massive speedup and cost savings for repeated queries
- **AI Demo & Documentation:**

The framework is composed of well-structured layers to ensure **modularity**, **maintainability**, and **scalability** across complex enterprise test environments.

### 1️⃣ Framework Layer – *The Foundation*
- Driver management (Selenium Grid/local/cloud)
- Config loading from external files
- Page Object Model (POM) structure
- Test data provider (Excel/JSON/DB)

### 2️⃣ Utility Classes – *Powering Reusability*
- Wait utilities (explicit/implicit/fluent)
- File, JSON, Excel handlers
- REST & SOAP service clients
- DB interaction (JDBC-based)
- Locator and email utilities
